#TODO for Garvey's Den

<s>1. Adjust reset and fall timing so both players match - need to make player 1 match 9 moves (to Turn 10 in code)</s>
<s>2. Add hittests for both players upon box "landing", before reset.</s>
<s>3. Make cage bottom transparent</s>
<s>4. Turn player1 into 2D side-scrolling view</s>
<s>5. Turn-based logic</s>
<s>6. Database functionality</s>
<s>7. PHP backend/API</s>
<s>8. Grid Framework</s>
<s>9. Automatic animation and framework code
<s>10. Change graphics - both should be aerial (top-down or bottom-up)</s>
<s>11. Ensure gameplay - you don't know what the other move is until you move (introduce element of luck) - on the last scene, both players see a cutscene while a killing or escaping animation takes place</s>
<s>12. Add new variable to be transmitted back and forth to keep track of who won - otherwise player 1 detects the winner after 7 turns (first), but then player 2 could make a move to change the outcome (turn 8)
	Since player 1 detects first, have him send the win or loss.
	BETTER IDEA! On the last "turn" (turn 8) in the code, player 2 cannot make a move, just watch the last move of p1. (Send in blank variables, progress. Set up some method to keep track of turns, and implement this on the last one)
		tl;dr T7: P1 makes final move, plays win sequence T8: p2 submits blank move (no change), animates final p1 move,then does same win sequence</s>
<s>13. Implement obstacles in flash that are already in PHP and db</s>
<s>14. Add music</s>

<s>1. Gameplay (see #10 and #11 above)</s>
<s>2. Highscores</s>
<s>3. Game to game interaction (what happens when one "match" finishes, and how to cut to cutscenes from game) - consider some sort of overlay (loadMovieClip?)</s>
<s>4. Multiplayer mechanism for end-of-game / last turn results (see #11 above) - Hittest necessary?</s>
<s>5. Implement obstacles - 0,1, or 2 (numb) randomly generated by PHP on database init, and then location (x,y) also generated - then sent to both clients who receive and put in game (before start)</s>

<s>Week 1: Finish graphics, and implement obstacles in code</s>
<s>Week 2: Scan and vectorize graphics</s>
<s>Week 3: Integrate graphics into game</s>
<s>Week 4: Animation</s>
Week 5: Animation, sound, and final touches
