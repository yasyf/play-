        <h1>Welcome to <a href="http://yasyf.github.com/play-/">Yasyf's Cousin Garvey's Den</a>!</h1>

<p><a href="http://garveysden.yasyf.com">Visit Homepage To Play</a></p>

<p>This is a simple turn-based game developed completely using AS 2 and PHP. </p>

<p>The objective of the game is either to drop cages on an enemy player, trapping him, or to avoid the cages being dropped.</p>

<p>The way this is accomplished is that each game starts with three cages positioned across the center of a 5x3 grid at positions (1,2), (3,2), and (5,2), and a player at (3,2).</p>

<p>On Player 1's turn, he can move his player one square in any 90Â° direction (up, down, left, right), space permitting</p>

<p>On Player 2's turn, he can move one of his three cages to anywhere on the grid (besides from the location occupied by the other two)</p>

<p>Player 2 will move first.</p>

<p>After both player's have made a move, the turn number increments, and the cages 'fall' one increment towards the ground.</p>

<p>After 7 increments (7 moves EACH), Player 2 will not make a move on the 8th turn, but observe.</p>

<p>Player 1 will make his 8th (final) turn, and then the game will decide the winner.</p>

<p>If the player is trapped, Player 2 wins. If the player escapes, Player 1 wins.</p>

<p>All communication between the two players is done via a PHP API and its connected MySQL Database.</p>

<p>All in-game data is processed independently on either end by AS 2, based on what the API returns.</p>

<h2><em>Notes</em></h2>

<p>-For my sanity, these will be the basic grid of the game. All external backgrounds/surroundings will be a SEPARATE flash file, so that I do not have to recode everything!</p>

<p>-External .as files are not up-to-date or reliable, and should not be referred to except for base framework code.</p>

<p>-ChangeLog is auto generated, and up-to-date since the second-latest commit (HEAD~1).</p>

<p>-For v5, we will not use a coded grid, but a movie clip with the symbol in its correct scale and position, with one frame per cell, so that playing through the movie clip (or going to a certain frame) will show the new position. This is not compatible with animating this move, so a solution must be found (possible using AS within the movie clip, if possible).</p>

<p>-Turns per game: 8</p>
