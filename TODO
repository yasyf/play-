//1. Adjust reset and fall timing so both players match
2. Add hittests for both players upon box "landing", before reset.
3. Make cage bottom transparent
4. Turn player1 into 2D side-scrolling veiw
//5. Turn-based logic
//6. Database functionaliy
//7. PHP backend/API
//8. Grid Framework
//9. Automatic animation and framework code
10. Change graphics - both should be aerial (top-down or bottom-up)
11. Ensure gameplay - you don't know what the other move is until you move (introduce element of luck) - on the last scene, both players see a cutscene while a killing or escaping animation takes place

Rafay

Yasyf
1. Gameplay (see #10 and #11 above)
2. Highscores
3. Game to game interaction (what happens when one "match" finishes, and how to cut to cutscenes from game) - consider some sort of overlay (loadMovieClip?)
4. Multiplayer mechanism for end-of-game / last turn results (see #11 above) - Hittest nessecery?
5. Implement obstacles - 0,1, or 2 (numb) randomly generated by PHP on database init, and then location (x,y) also generated - then sent to both clients who receive and put in game (before start)
